# sqlalchemy-challenge
Please, find the code in Jupyter and app.py file for FLask coding. 
I partially followed the speedrun for Module 10 challenge as I could not get min, avg, and max temperatures in app.py (flask) varying the dates (<start>/<end>). Somehow, that error persists on the speedrun video as well.
